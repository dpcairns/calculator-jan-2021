## Outcomes
 
- Addition - GOAL: Display the sum of two numbers to the user
HTML SETUP: We should see on the screen: two user input boxes, a plus sign, and a button (there is also a secret box where we put the result)
 - Why: do we need the input box? Because that's where the user input lives so we can add the numbers
 - Why: do we need the button? We need something to click to tell the computer to show the answer
 - Why: do we need a secret box? We need a place to make the answer actually visible
 - Validation: Look at the screen
1) Grab the dom elements (the input box and the button) in javascript (using the id attribute)
 - How: make variables for each dom element, using `document.getElementById('whatever-id')`
 - Validation: we can log the DOM elements out
2) Add an event listener to the button
 - Validation: console.log 'hello world' on click
3) Get access to what the user typed in
 - How: get the `.value` property of the input element
 - Validation: we can log out the user input (the number they type) on click (in the "cool zone" of the event handler)
4) Use the user input to calculate the results
 - Validation: log out the result to the console (in the cool zone)
5) Display that result to the user
 - How: we need to grab the secret box, and inject the answer into its `textContent` property (in the cool zone)
 - Validation: we should see it on the screen
